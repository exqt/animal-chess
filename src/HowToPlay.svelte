<h1>How to play</h1>

<h2>How to win</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The player who first catches the opponent's 🦁 wins.</li>
  <li>You also win the game if your 🦁 safely reaches the opponent's area (last row). However, you lose if the end 🦁 is caught right after he reaches there.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Other rules</h2>
<ol>
  <li>When a 🐤 reachs the the opponent's area (last row), it grows to become a 🐓.</li>
  <li>When a 🐓 is captured, it becomes back to a 🐤.</li>
</ol>
